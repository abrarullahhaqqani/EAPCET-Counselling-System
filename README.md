# EAPCET-Counselling-System
In this project, I have designed a database management system to store and manage the information about a student's registration and counselling process for the EAPCET exam. The Database will contain important information about the students and will be accessible to counselling authorities and the student himself.
This database management system will help the student and the officials during the whole examination and counselling process, which will vary from admit card release to counselling result (seat allotment).
This Database will contain the students' details, exam details, result of the examination, choices filled during the counselling process and its corresponding results.
Our Database will provide complete transparency during the whole counselling process.
